.. project-brief-start-do-not-remove

A C++ implementation of a finite deformation linear elastic micromorphic constitutive model

************
Dependencies
************

.. dependencies-start-do-not-remove

For convenience, the minimal Conda environment requirements for project development are included in ``environment.txt``.
A minimal anaconda environment for building the documentation can be created from an existing anaconda installation with
the following commands.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda create --name tardigrade-micromorphic-linear-elasticity-env --file environment.txt --channel file:///projects/aea_compute/aea-conda

You can learn more about Anaconda Python environment creation and management in
the `Anaconda Documentation`_.

The build, test, and run time requirements are subsets of the development environment requirements found in
``environment.txt``. This project builds and deploys as a Conda package to the `AEA Conda channel`_. The Conda recipe
and build, test, run time requirements are found in the ``recipe/`` directory.

.. dependencies-end-do-not-remove

**************
Build and Test
**************

.. build-start-do-not-remove

This project is built with `CMake`_ and uses `Sphinx`_ to build the
documentation with `Doxygen`_ + `Breathe`_ for the c++ API.

Environment variables
=====================

This project's `CMake`_ configuration accepts two build type strings: 'Release' and 'conda-test'. The first is used
during the Gitlab-CI ``fast-test`` job to ensure that the project uses installed libraries correctly. The latter is used
during the Gitlab-CI ``conda-build`` job to limit the test phase to the as-installed project files.

The build type can be set with the ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build type string>`` during project configuration. Both build
types will require the upstream dependent libraries

* ``error_tools``: https://github.com/UCBoulder/tardigrade_error_tools
* ``vector_tools``: https://github.com/UCBoulder/tardigrade_vector_tools
* ``constitutive_tools``: https://github.com/UCBoulder/tardigrade_constitutive_tools
* ``stress_tools``: https://github.com/UCBoulder/tardigrade_stress_tools
* ``micromorphic_tools``: https://github.com/UCBoulder/tardigrade_micromorphic_tools

to be installed and found in the user's environment. If the build type string doesn't match those previously listed, the
CMake project will build missing upstream libraries with the `CMake fetch_content`_ feature. The 'conda-test' build type
excludes the project libraries from the build configuration and will attempt to find the project libraries in the user's
environment to perform the project unit and integration tests against the as-installed project files.

Building the documentation
==========================

    **HEALTH WARNING**

    The sphinx API docs are a work-in-progress. The doxygen API is much more useful.

To build just the documentation pick up the steps here:

2) Create the build directory and move there

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/tardigrade-micromorphic-linear-elasticity/
      $ mkdir build/
      $ cd build/

3) Run cmake configuration

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/tardigrade-micromorphic-linear-elasticity/build/
      $ cmake ..

4) Build the docs

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cmake --build . --target Sphinx

5) Documentation builds to:

   .. code-block:: bash

      tardigrade-micromorphic-linear-elasticity/build/docs/sphinx/html/index.html

6) Display docs

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/tardigrade-micromorphic-linear-elasticity/build/
      $ firefox docs/sphinx/html/index.html &

7) While the Sphinx API is still a WIP, try the doxygen API

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/tardigrade-micromorphic-linear-elasticity/build/
      $ firefox docs/doxygen/html/index.html &

*******************
Install the library
*******************

Build the entire before performing the installation.

4) Build the entire project

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/tardigrade-micromorphic-linear-elasticity/build
      $ cmake --build .

5) Install the library

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pwd
      /path/to/tardigrade-micromorphic-linear-elasticity/build
      $ cmake --install . --prefix path/to/root/install

      # Example local user (non-admin) Linux install
      $ cmake --install . --prefix /home/$USER/.local

      # Example install to conda environment
      $ conda activate my_env
      $ cmake --install . --prefix ${CONDA_PREFIX}

Contribution Guidelines
***********************

.. contribution-start-do-not-remove

Git Commit Message
==================

Begin Git commit messages with one of the following headings:

* BUG: bug fix
* DOC: documentation
* FEAT: feature
* MAINT: maintenance
* TST: tests
* REL: release
* WIP: work-in-progress

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   git commit -m "DOC: adds documentation for feature"

Git Branch Names
================

When creating branches use one of the following naming conventions. When in
doubt use ``feature/<description>``.

* ``bugfix/\<description>``
* ``feature/\<description>``
* ``release/\<description>``

reStructured Text
=================

`Sphinx`_ reads in docstrings and other special portions of the code as reStructured text. Developers should follow
styles in this `Sphinx style guide
<https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html#>`_.

Style Guide
===========

This project uses the `gersemi`_ CMake linter. The CI style guide check runs the following command

.. code-block:

   $ gersemi CMakeLists.txt src/ docs/ --check

and any automatic fixes may be reviewed and then applied by developers with the following commands

.. code-block:

   $ gersemi CMakeLists.txt src/ docs/ --diff
   $ gersemi CMakeLists.txt src/ docs/ --in-place

This project enforces its style using `clang-tidy`_ and `clang-format`_ as configured with the
`.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` files in the root directory. The formatting of the project can be
checked using `clang-tidy`_ by first configuring the project using

.. code-block:

   $ cmake -S . -B build ... -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON

where `...` are the other configuration flags specified. After this clang-tidy can be run on the
full project from the source directory via

.. CAUTION::
    Commit all changes prior to running the clang tidy command. This will edit all source files.

.. code-block:

   $ run-clang-tidy -config-file=.clang-tidy -p build -extra-arg="-mno-sse2"

The formatting can be checked using `clang-format`_ by running

.. code-block:

   $ cmake -S . -B build ...
   $ cmake --build build --target cpp-format-check

which will indicate if the formatting is correct. The c++ files can be re-formatted to match the
style guidance by running

.. CAUTION::
    Commit all changes prior to running the format command. This will edit all source files.

.. code-block

   $ cmake --build build --target cpp-format

If the style is not constrained by the above, it should be inferred by the surrounding code.
Wherever a style can't be inferred from surrounding code this project falls back to `PEP-8`_-like
styles the exceptions to the notional PEP-8 fall back:

1. `Doxygen`_ style docstrings are required for automated, API from source documentation.
